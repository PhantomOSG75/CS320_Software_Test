# CS320_Software_Test
This includes all the assignments that were required to complete the CS-320 Class
What I have learned throughout this class:

Testing helps not only ensure that your code is functional and secure
However, it can also save you, your employer, and your client money by catching issues and errors.

Always take your client's needs, wants, and what they require for the application or software. 
Such as the boundaries of the input needed, outputs needed, etc.

I like to make lists of what the client's needs and requirements are.
Then design a flowchart on my pc to figure out the flow needed to show the directions
in which the application needs to work properly.

After the flowchart is designed and includes everything needed as a whole, then break it down into classes to be able to 
to create smaller tidbits that will work as a whole.

Now, create pseudocode for each class needed, unless you have a previous class that will work within the existing project.

Once this is all completed. Now, I have my outline and necessities for my code. Time to start writing code.

I like to write small tidbits of code and run the code to look for errors. I believe that the more errors you can catch while writing the code, then that is just one less bug you will have to find later.
